# Dungeon Description Language

DDL is a suite of tools and definitions designed to make designing and illustrating full on D&D encounter maps much simpler. It is built of several parts which can either function independently, or as a full stack:

## The Dungeon Definition

A standard for declaring the layout of a dungeon in terms of things the Dungeon Master actually cares about.

## The Architect

The architect takes a dungeon definition, and can convert it into a geometrically valid layout.

## The Artist

Takes a layout, decides which pieces of artwork to use to render it either top-down or isometrically, and then outputs the result.
